# ace-remoteQM-policy
Non-production examples of remote default queue manager policies for ACE v11 servers; these examples are intended to illustrate how such policies are used and some common errors, but should not be viewed as best practice for actual deployments.

## Remote default overview; link to docs, "when?" blog, node properties 
 TODO
 
## Explain how policies are actually just XML files on disk that can be copied, generated, modified, etc without needing a BAR file
 TODO
 
## Overrides versus run
 TODO

## Credentials; need for setdbparms or mqsicredentials before server starts up
 TODO

## Startup for remote default; when the server does different things, what errors can happen when, etc.
 TODO

## Auto-shutdown
 TODO
